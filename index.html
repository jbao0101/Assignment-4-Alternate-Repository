      <p style="text-align: center; font-size: xx-large;">A Short Story by Joe Bao</p>
      <p style="font-size: large;">**First thing's first, there is no difference between the terms "Table Tennis" and "Ping Pong". Some people who have been deeply entrenched in the sport itself may even try to make a big deal out of the two names, but for the most part there is no difference. "Ping Pong"
         simply derives from the Chinese name for Table Tennis, so either name is fine. One name is not "superior" to the other, although you may see "Table Tennis" being used predominantly in official English speaking settings, such as the International Table Tennis Federation. This is important to mention because I will be arbitrarily switching between the two terms a lot
         and I don't want it to confuse anyone.**</p>

            <h2>First Contact</h2>
            <p id="testP" class="funParagraph">Growing up, I had two insecurities: Firstly, I was not very athletic nor coordinated. I never got involved in sports outside of gym class, and this extended well into my early teenage years. Secondly, I always felt like I was out of touch with my Chiense heritage. 
               My lack of athleticism led to a sort of inferiority complex when it comes to physical talent, and my feeling of not being "Chinese enough" led to me feeling like I was a shame to my heritage.
               This is important to note because, despite having grown up viewing ping pong as just a game to play to pass time or a game that I would simply play at my local swimming pool or friend's house, one day it clicked for me that ping pong would was the answer to a few of my problems.
               When I was about 5th or 6th grade, I used to only play intermittently with a friend of mine at the local community pool where there was an outdoor table, and I would always lose. That is, until one day I actually had gotten good enough to where I beat him for the first time ever. I imagine this was one of the very first
               times that I had beaten anyone in any sort of physical or skillful competition. It sparked something in me that made me think "wait a minute, I might be pretty good at this". I may not have been good at basketball, soccer, football, etc. But this ping pong thing, I might just be pretty good at this. 
               Not only did it feed my ego, but getting good at ping pong would mean that I would be doing justice to my heritage, since it's known that the sport is popular in China as their athletes dominate the professional stage. This is all immature thinking in hindsight, but back then, this was how I thought about things. My beginnings in the sport
               stemmed from unhealthy thinking and perspectives, but I would slowly and surely start to fall in a more pure love with the sport.

            <h2>First Steps</h2>
            <p>I would continue to only play intermittently just because I didn't know where else or who else to play. However, in eighth grade, we had a table tennis unit in gym class. We had a class tournament which I would win and beat one of my highly respected athletic friends/classmate in the final. This just reinforced the idea 
               once and for all that table tennis was my calling. After that, I immediately went home, convinced my older siblings to buy a cheap set of ping pong paddles and balls. We cleared off a table that was roughly the size of a ping pong table, set up an oatmeal creampie box as the net, and got to playing. We would play for hours,
               and I would invite my other friends over to play with us. It was a blast of a time, and it helped nurture my love for the sport. Eventually, my older siblings and my parents pitched in for an actual ping pong table for me and my brothers, but I would be the one that would be the most emotionally invested in it and use it the most.

            <h2>Learning Together</h2>
            <p>I would go on to play a lot with my brothers and my friends, but I would play with one friend the most. For privacy purposes, he will be referred to as Todd. Todd and I started to play each other a lot, and we would learn with each other throughout freshman and sophomore years of high school. We would watch videos online for 
               technique and improvement, and then bring that knowledge to <a href="https://youtu.be/JR4td6fRxJ4?t=6">my table in my basement</a>. When we learned to drive, it opened up avenues to <a href="https://youtu.be/oWlMF86_I-A">play at our local YMCA</a> where there was a table in the lounge, and to play at the one and only local table tennis club (St. Louis Table Tennis Club) that would meet at a local government center. 
               We would meet all sorts of people at the YMCA and at the STL club. However, one thing was apparent: we could not learn everything by ourselves using only YouTube. We would get crushed by everyone we played outside of absolute beginners and our other friends. What we needed most was coaching, and after combing through just a handful of 
               pages on google, we came to the disappointing realization that there was no opportunity for coaching in St. Louis. We were on our own. We accepted this and tried our best to continue to learn and teach ourselves, but eventually Todd and I would grow tired of the lack of opportunity.

            <h2>Leap of Faith</h2>
            <p>Fast forward to 2017 when Todd and I are sophomores in undergrad at Truman University. We still played ping pong maybe once a week or two, but we didn't play as regularly as we did in high school. We were just busier, and our lack of improvement and meaningful progress was disheartening. But then one day, I somehow heard about a club
               in New Jersey that was heralded as one of the best clubs in the nation for training young athletes into table tennis champions. I did more research and saw that they did summer camps for training. After doing the math, I realized that our long awaited coaching and professional guidance was actually quite realistic and attainable. So with that, 
               Todd and I took a leap of faith and set off to New Jersey for two weeks to get lessons for the first time in our careers. We weren't sure how it would be, how it would turn out, or if it would be worth the time and money, but we just couldn't resist the temptation to fulfill one of our dreams.

            <a name="Growing Pains"></a>
            <h2>Growing Pains</h2>
            <p>When we entered the New Jersey club for the first time, we were welcomed by a couple of players hitting some unbelievable shots back and forth, back and forth, without missing a beat. We were introduced to the club's owner, whose house we were staying at, and played briefly before heading to our host's house to crash and prepare for the next day.
               That first day of training was an eye opener. I cannot describe Todd's experience for him, since we were often split up doing different things due to our differences in areas that need improvement, but what I can say is that this was one of the most frustrating times of my table tennis career. It turns out that trying to teach myself everything
               through online videos without having a set of eyes critiquing my progress led to me building up some very, <em>very</em> bad habits. I used too umch shoulder, so it looked like I was shrugging every time I hit a forehand. I was too wild, so my swing was all over the place and not controlled. I brushed the ball too much, meaning I was swiping up 
               at the ball more than driving forward into and through the ball. I essentially spent the entirety of the two weeks at this camp <a href="https://youtu.be/EbKWHSQ-LWE?t=7"> fixing these issues</a> and rebuilding my foundation and mechanics from the ground up. This was incredibly frustrating since it felt like I lost any and all progress I had made in the past few years, just to be worse than before
               since what I was learning had not yet had time to be committed to muscle memory. By the end of the camp, I went home feeling defeated that I had to relearn everything, but also relieved and thankful that I was finally on the right track to learning and building the correct fundamentals.

            <h2>First Outing</h2>
            <p>Between the first and second weeks of the training camp, Todd and I went to upstate New York for a table tennis tournament from the suggestion of our host, the club owner's son. We jumped at the opportunity to participate in an official tournament and see how we would fare. After reading the last paragraph, it may be no surprise to you that I personally
               did not fare well <em>at all.</em> I lost every single match, even to people who I felt like I should have been beating and who I thought I would have beaten if I wasn't in the middle of overhauling my technique. To rub salt in my wound, my friend Todd won first place in his event, showing that he was able to put what he learned into practice
               immediately while I was struggling. I was happy for him, and even helped coach him in the final, but I would be lying if there wasn't a hint of jealousy from me. A few months after our experience in New Jersey and New York, Todd and I decide to try our hand at another tournament just outside of Chicago. However, this time both of us would 
               know only defeat. We both lost nearly every match, showing once again that we were far from where we wanted to be. This was extremely disheartening for me, and I would swear off from competitive table tennis for a long time after this.

            <h2>Picking Myself Back Up</h2>
            <p>I would continue playing intermittently whenever we returned to university. I would play with Todd and a few other friends, as well as participating in some small intramural tournaments hosted by my school, but I never considered going back to another official sanctioned tournament like the ones in New York and Chicago. I just
               didn't have the confidence anymore. I would <a href="https://youtu.be/GFPKHaf5jsE">continue to practice</a>, hoping it would help solidify what I had learned (and in hindsight I'm glad I did continue to practice since it definitely did help solidify my fundamentals), but I had no clear goal in sight, and no clear direction. The only person that I felt I could have any sort of 
               meaningful practice with was Todd, but he was scarcely available when I wanted to play, so it was difficult for me to stay motivated. I was spiritually lost. That is until late 2019. For 
               one reason or another, I felt the incredible urge to compete in another tournament to prove myself. I considered going back to New Jersey for more training, thinking this time I was ready to really kickstart my improvement to my game. I was saving up to go back to the camp in Summer 2020, I started playing more with Todd and started
               going to the local club again, and I was looking at tournaments I could travel to within reason. I got my first job after college and had expendable income, so I bought myself a nice ball machine so I could practice on my own. I was ready to pick myself up out of my slump, but then COVID hit. All my plans went on standby indefinitely as the whole world 
               came to a stop. Thankfully, I had already purchased the machine so I could continue <a href="https://youtu.be/f8YutSqAKi8">practicing on my own</a> without needing a partner or going to the local club, but it didn't feel like enough. I was once again in a lull in my table tennis career as I was forced to let COVID take the reigns. I would continue to wait patiently, biding my time, until something 
               caught my eye in the summer of 2021, over a year later.

            <h2>The Return</h2>
            <p>After having checked the USA Table Tennis page for tournaments consistently, seeing when they would start being held again after COVID, I finally saw hope in 2021. There was a tournament being held in Springfield, MO, just a rock's throw from St. Louis. So naturally, I had to go. I convinced Todd to go with me, and off we went. This was the 
               tournament that I had been waiting for. This was the tournament that I had spent all those hours at university practicing for after the camp. This was why I started going back to the club again, and this was what the ball machine was for. I went to this tournament with a new resolve, that I would not care about how many matches I'd win, or who 
               I would beat, but rather focus on one thing only: being better than the last version of me at the last tournament. Before my first match, I went to the bathroom with my headphones, put on music, and just did my best to meditate briefly. I thought to myself over and over again, "Don't worry about winning, just stay loose and have fun." Then, before I knew it, 
               it was time to play.

            <a name="The Fight"></a>
            <h2>The Fight</h2>
            <p>My first match was against a girl who was maybe in high school. You could tell she had good coaching as her fundamentals looked good, but you could also tell that she was inexperienced and didn't have much match play experience. She was very ridgid and didn't handle variety very well. I ended up beating her in straight sets, 3-0. 
               My next opponent was a guy about my age who played with a funny paddle that was smaller than normal, and his form was less refined than the girl who I had just beaten, but you could tell he had more match experience as he was not as easily tripped up by the variety of spin I would give him. After taking a couple sets to settle in, I would eventually beat him 3-1. 
               Then came my final match of the group play which would determine if I would advance to the elimnation round. My final opponent was an older gentleman, maybe in his mid to late 60's or so. He wasn't very athletic, but he had a good feel for the game and was consistent. Warming up against him, he made some comment about how good my shots were and how my youth
                and skill would beat him easily. I laughed and didn't say much to him, but inside I thought about how I needed to focus on the match and each individual point at play, rather than whether I should or should not win against this person. The match begins, and I start off shaky in the first set. I have some decent points, but overall I was making a lot of
                errors and was rushing a lot. I ended up losing the first set, and immediately negative thoughts started to creep in as we prepared for the next set. &quot;<em>Is this it? Is this where my run ends? Have I not actually improved at all? Will I once again lose to someone who I feel like I should beat? Do I just not have what it takes to win?</em>&quot; </p>
               
               <p>I did my best to 
               clear my mind and focused only on the next set. I thought to myself that I needed to play more aggressive, as I was being too passive in the first set which was allowing my opponent to take advantage and hit too many winning shots against me. So this set, I tried to attack his serve more, and try to play smarter shots. I started off hot, winning point after 
               point until I won the second set relatively comfortably. I would go on to win the third set quite comfortably as well. The match score is now tied at 2-1 in my favor. I was one set away from winning the match and going on to the elimnation round. However, my opponent wouldn't go down without a fight. He adjusted to my aggressiveness and in turn 
               increased the quality of his shots. He pressured me more with placement and spin. We were trading blows, and had a couple of good points. I don't remember the exact score, but I remember the set score was quite close, maybe around 8-7 or 9-7 in my favor, when we had a very pivotal back and forth point. I was under a lot of mental pressure at this point 
               because as I just mentioned, the set score was very close. If my opponent won this set, then the match score would be tied at 2-2 and we would have to play the final set, and if he won the fourth set to force a fifth set, then with his momentum, anything could happen in the fifth set. So at around 8-7 in the third set, we have a point that starts off 
               with a few weaker hits back and forth, both of us waiting for someone to take the risk and hit the first aggressive shot.
               I was able to shoot off a strong shot, but to my surprise he returned it back with force which caught me off guard, so I scrambled to return his shot which forced me to hit a weak return, popping the ball up and putting me on the defensive. I backed away from the table, preparing for his strong forehand smash. 
               I was preparing to lob the ball up and back onto the table if I needed to, but luckily for me, he smashed it directly to my 
               sweet spot. From about 15 feet from the table, his smash comes straight to my forehand, and I just let loose and hit it back with strong pace and spin. He was able to return my shot, but just barely this time back to my backhand side. I didn't want to waste this opportunity that I had worked so hard to create, so instead of hitting a passive shot just to 
               get it back on the table, I shuffle back in toward the table and let my backhand rip, shooting the ball directly toward his body so he could neither play a forehand nor backhand, finally finishing the point as the ball hit his body. There is a common celebratory phrase in table tennis that's spelled phonetically as <a href="https://youtu.be/nJeVZxhvlAU?t=123">
               "cho"</a>, which stems from the Mandarin-Chinese 
               word for "ball". It's not terribly uncommon for players to cheer themselves on after winning a point and yelling "Cho!", but I have always been a more reserved person, especially in sports, so this wasn't something I was used to. However, to help myself stay loose and to hype myself up, I jokingly told Todd before my match started that for 
               every point I win, I would yell "CHO!" so loudly that it would echo throughout the gym. As fate would have it, I would do exactly that. After winning that pivotal point in such a strong manner, I yelled and released a loud "CHO!!" while fist pumping and looking to the crowd to see Todd watching and laughing in his seat as I fulfilled my joke of a promise. 
               And to my surprise, other people in the stands were also watching. The gym happened to be relatively quiet at this moment as many of the other matches had wrapped up, so my yell actually did echo a bit throughout the gym, drawing attention from resting players and spectators. I ended up winning the last few points to secure my victory at 3-1, 
               but that point was the defining point of the tournament for me. I finally pushed through my adversity in negative thinking to achieve a goal and, not only win a few matches at a tournament, but also move on to my 
               first elimination round. As I prepared for my next match, my friend congratulated me and joked about my yelling. I laughed with him, acknowledging how silly it may have looked, but I didn't let that take away from the pride of my accomplishment as I looked ahead to my next match in the elimination round.

            <h2>At The End of the Day</h2>
            <p>My next match wasn't anything terribly special. My next opponent was similar to my second opponent, in that he was a guy who didn't have very strong fundamentals, but he had a lot of experience. He had a very good serve that would look like the same motion but create wildly different spins, causing me to produce a lot of errors. We had a couple of 
               good points, but in the end, I lost to him 1-3, ending my run in this event. I was disappointed that it ended so anti-climactically after such a riveting match prior to that, but I was still happy with my performance and I was glad that I simply improved since my last tournament. After the event, I assumed that I didn't win anything as I didn't get 
               past the first round in the elimination round. However, to my surprise, there were only three groups with one person from each group advancing to the elimination round, which means that reaching the elimination round at all guarantees placing at least 3rd place. So, much to my surprise, I had actually won a bronze medal for 3rd place and was asked 
               to take a picture with the tournament director for their records and to post about later. At first, I didn't place much value in this 3rd place finish. I didn't feel like I deserved it since I didn't even make it past the first elimination round. But after mulling over it for a bit, it occurred to me that I was being too harsh on myself. I may have 
               lost the first elimination round match, but I had to win three other matches before getting there. I had a better record than 9 of the 12 participants in the event, including Todd who had bested me so many times in the past but this time had failed to make it out of his group. As much as I felt like I hadn't deserved it, I changed my perspective on things,  
               learned to appreciate my 3rd place finish and to allow myself to be genuinely proud for once, hence why this assignment which was supposed to be relatively short became so long and drawn out. At the end of the day, this was my first win in table tennis in an official competitive setting that I was able to take genuine pride in. Since then I've only 
               gotten better, so I hope that that medal is the first of many. My dream is to one day get good enough to where I could open up my own club in St. Louis and offer much needed lessons and coaching in the area, but until then, I will keep working and improving as both a player and an ambassador for the sport that I've come to love.
